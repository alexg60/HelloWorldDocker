## 🐳 Docker and Java Integration

As part of our project, we demonstrated how to compile and run a simple Java application using Docker. This helps simulate real-world deployment environments and adds hands-on experience with containerization.

### ✅ Java Program
**HelloWorld.java**
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Docker and Java!");
    }
}
